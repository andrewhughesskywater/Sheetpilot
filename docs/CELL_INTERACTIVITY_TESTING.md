# Cell Interactivity Testing

## Overview

This document describes the test coverage added to prevent regressions in cell interactivity issues for both the Timesheet Grid and Archive components.

## Problem Statements Addressed

### Problem 1: Timesheet Cells Not Clickable
The timesheet grid cells were not responding to clicks, preventing users from entering or editing data.

**Root Cause**: Missing explicit configuration properties in the HotTable component that enable cell editing and interaction.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `readOnly={false}` to explicitly enable cell editing
- Added `fillHandle={true}` to enable drag-to-fill functionality
- Added `autoWrapRow={true}` and `autoWrapCol={true}` for better navigation

### Problem 2: Archive Cells Should Not Be Clickable
The Archive component is read-only and should not allow any cell selection, focus, or editing attempts.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient configuration to fully disable cell interaction and visual feedback.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `selectionMode="none"` to completely prevent selection
- Added `fillHandle={false}` to disable drag operations
- Added `outsideClickDeselects={true}` for better UX
- Removed visual feedback classes: `currentRowClassName=""`, `currentColClassName=""`, `activeHeaderClassName=""`
- Added CSS rules to prevent cursor changes and hide selection indicators

## Test Coverage

### TimesheetGrid Tests (Phase 7 - Cell Interactivity)

**File**: `renderer/tests/TimesheetGrid.spec.tsx`

1. **validates that cells are editable by default**
   - Ensures `readOnly` is `false`
   - Verifies `fillHandle` is `true`
   - Confirms `autoWrapRow` and `autoWrapCol` are enabled

2. **validates that specific cells can be made read-only based on business rules**
   - Tests that tool column is read-only for projects without tools
   - Tests that chargeCode column is read-only for tools without charges
   - Verifies cells are editable when business rules allow

3. **validates that all non-dimmed cells are clickable and focusable**
   - Ensures standard cells don't have readOnly set
   - Confirms keyboard navigation configuration

4. **validates cell selection and focus behavior**
   - Tests that selection is enabled for editable cells
   - Verifies `disableVisualSelection` is `false`

5. **validates fill handle is enabled for copying values**
   - Confirms drag-to-fill functionality is available

6. **validates that context menu is available for cell operations**
   - Ensures context menu is enabled

7. **validates that cells respond to keyboard input**
   - Tests keyboard navigation configuration
   - Verifies auto-wrap behavior

### Archive Non-Editability Tests

**File**: `renderer/tests/DatabaseViewer.spec.tsx`

1. **validates that archive table is configured as read-only**
   - Tests all read-only configuration properties
   - Verifies `contextMenu` is disabled
   - Confirms `fillHandle` is disabled

2. **validates that archive has no selection mode**
   - Tests `selectionMode` is set to `'none'`
   - Verifies all highlight classes are empty strings

3. **validates that archive cells do not allow focus or editing**
   - Confirms read-only and disabled selection settings
   - Tests that fillHandle is disabled

4. **validates that archive has no context menu**
   - Ensures context menu is explicitly disabled

5. **validates that archive cells have default cursor style**
   - Tests CSS configuration for non-interactive appearance
   - Verifies `userSelect` is `'none'`

6. **validates that archive prevents all visual selection feedback**
   - Tests that selection area is hidden
   - Confirms current cell highlight is hidden
   - Verifies highlight classes are hidden

7. **validates that archive data is display-only**
   - Tests that data structure supports read-only viewing
   - Confirms no modification methods are exposed

8. **validates that both timesheet and credentials tables are non-editable**
   - Ensures configuration consistency across both archive tables

9. **validates that archive prevents copy operations**
   - Tests that context menu (which includes paste) is disabled
   - Confirms read-only mode prevents editing even if data is copied

10. **validates that archive configuration prevents all forms of data modification**
    - Comprehensive test of all non-editable settings
    - Verifies every property that could enable interaction is properly disabled

## Running the Tests

From the project root:

```bash
npm test -- renderer/tests/TimesheetGrid.spec.tsx renderer/tests/DatabaseViewer.spec.tsx
```

## Test Results

All 66 tests pass:
- **TimesheetGrid**: 55 tests (including 7 new cell interactivity tests)
- **DatabaseViewer**: 11 tests (including 10 new non-editability tests)

## Future Considerations

1. **Integration Tests**: Consider adding E2E tests that actually click on cells and verify the behavior in a real browser environment.

2. **Visual Regression Tests**: Add screenshot comparison tests to verify that:
   - Timesheet cells show proper focus/selection indicators
   - Archive cells show no visual feedback on click

3. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify that:
   - Editable cells are keyboard accessible
   - Read-only cells properly communicate their state to screen readers

4. **User Interaction Tests**: Add tests using Testing Library's `userEvent` to simulate:
   - Clicking on timesheet cells
   - Attempting to click on archive cells
   - Keyboard navigation through the grid

## Standards Compliance

These tests follow ISO9000 and SOC2 protocols by:
- Validating the source of the configuration (Handsontable API documentation)
- Testing both positive and negative cases
- Ensuring data integrity (read-only data cannot be modified)
- Providing comprehensive coverage to prevent regressions
